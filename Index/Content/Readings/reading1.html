	<b>1.</b> In the modern world where technology is becoming more and more invisible, there is a conscious effort to make users aware only of what they are doing with technology rather than the device they are doing it with. This has triggered the desire to rephrase the idea of ‘interface design’ to ‘experience design’, and many industry professionals redefining the word ‘user’ to ‘people’ in an effort to acknowledge that the user, a human being, needs to be considered in designing the experience of a product.<br><br>

However, Lialina believes this idea is too narrow in context, and the word ‘user’ is meaningful. She writes that it is a pity to describe such a variety of roles and methods of participation the new technology world allows us - into the narrow term ‘users’. But she deems this term accurate because we are using systems that we did not develop or program - therefore, a ‘user’ is precisely what we all are.<br><br>

Lialina thinks that using the word ‘people’ over ‘users’ is a problematic way of losing the distinction between developers and users, which may lead to the loss of users' rights in demanding improved software, deleting their files, and more. Most importantly, the lack of distinction will cause users to lose the last reminder that they are subjects of interaction with a piece of technology.<br><br>

<b>2.</b> Lialina describes the ideal internet user as ‘The General Purpose User / Universal Users / Turing Complete Users’. These are users who can achieve their intended goals or tasks when coming across a piece of technology no matter what purpose the application / device is originally intended for. The Universal User’s mindset is flexible and challenges what users and applications are meant to do, staying visible to themselves while interacting with technology.<br><br>

<b>3.</b> An example of an interaction I came across on the web (that acknowledges a user’s presence) is registering for courses at OCAD University. The process of using the registration website is not smooth or automatic, because it needs multiple steps completed both on and off the screen by the user in order to successfully complete its intended purpose. 

<ul class="a">
<li>Registration screen opened</li>
<li>Students are expected to contemplate which courses they will be adding to the schedule (By using external resources online or offline, like the program course guide, speaking to an academic advisor, etc.) Or, they are expected to have first checked their progress in another tab called ‘My progress’.</li>
<li>The user manually searches for courses.</li>
<li>The user has to choose the sections (class times) they want to register for, manually adding each one to the schedule.</li>
<li>Users are expected to return after some time has passed in order to press the Register button, which is not automated by the website but requires the user’s presence at an exact moment in time. This is necessary in order for the page/user to complete the intended goal - to successfully register a course schedule.</li>
<li>If waitlisted on a course, the student is expected to make a personal decision offline to remove it, or wait for the possibility for it to open - which are all manual processes completed by the user at a later time.</li></ul></p>
