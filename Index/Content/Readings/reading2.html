	<h1>Reading Response 2: Answers</h1>


<div class="box"><p>
	<b>1.</b> By asking us to ‘defamiliarize our tools’, Seu means to stop using the tools on our devices in ’automated’, meaningless motions. She believes we are so used to our digital tools that we forget we're interacting with our devices – Instead, they become invisible, empty in purpose, even though they’re essential in completing our tasks. In a world where technology is so accessible and even taken for granted, we often don’t reflect on these tools when we're using them. By asking us to join her in ‘defamiliarizing our tools’, Seu is encouraging our engagement of technology in a more conscious and meaningful way. Digital poems, or ‘poetry’ in her words therefore mean a way of perceiving the digital world as a language; a living piece. To her, digital poems are not just the ’tools’ on our devices but something that is alive and means something greater than its function. <br><br>

<b>2. </b>‘Performing Data’ is a category of work that reassembles and builds upon existing data, creating some kind of a visual display or performance. When arranged to be showcased in a certain way or sequence, a set of found material can create not just static data, but digital poetry. A website that operates within this definition is http://alltheminutes.com/ (Links to an external site.) This website collected tweets from the past and present written by people all over the world that include keywords of a certain time in the day, and organized them in order of the described time. The result gives the viewer a minute-by-minute look at what people are/were up to at a given time, and what they were sharing with the internet at that moment. By stringing the Tweets into one collective story organized by time, the website creates a unique narrative. This is an example where found material on the web – or data – was reordered and arranged in a performative way.</p></div>
