<div class="one"><h1>Tableau One</h1>
<p><b>Task:</b><br>Using your laptop background and icons, create a composition on your desktop in a way that best describes: Who you are, What you like, What you make.Take a screenshot. Upload.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br> I created this desktop arrangement to visualize first: me at a distance (as a stick figure),then me at a close up view (hence the smiley face), and then me inside my brain(a question mark symbolizing that I was confused by the assignment) </p><br>

<h1>Tableau Two</h1>
<p><b>Task:</b><br>Create a self-portrait by opening and rearranging windows on computer.Then take a screenshot.Pay attention to the content of your windows, the programs you use as well as the formal arrangement of your windows.Be expressive, not literal.<b><br><br>Explanation:</b><br> I created this desktop arrangement of the many, many screens I had open on my laptop at the time tosymbolize how my laptop screen looks most of the time - I am somebody who often focuses on multiple tasks at a time, and finds it hard to close applications / tabs while on the computer. I also tend to feel very overwhelmed with balancing volunteer work, a part time job, and course work at school, so my laptop is often super cluttered with current projects I'm working on.</p><br>
